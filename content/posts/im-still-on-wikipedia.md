Yes.

I am still on Wikipedia.

Many people may say it's a bad idea to rely on Wikipedia as a source of information, but what are the alternatives?
- Sponsored articles
- AI-generated articles (which are often used to keep you on the website for long enough to show you ads and most of the information is wrong)
- Articles written by people who don't know what they're talking about
- Articles written by people who are biased
- Articles written by people who are paid to write them
