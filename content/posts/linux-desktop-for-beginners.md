If you've stumbled upon this article without even knowing what Linux is, I would recommend that you read [this article](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-linux) from Red Hat first. If you already know what Linux is but are unsure whether or not it is the right operating system for you, I would recommend that you read [this article](https://itsfoss.com/linux-better-than-windows/) from It's FOSS! first.

## How can you use Linux as a daily desktop?
Using Linux as your daily desktop is easier than you might think. Most Linux distributions come with a user-friendly interface that is similar to Windows or macOS, called a Desktop Environment. Additionally, many Linux distributions come with a suite of pre-installed applications, including web browsers, email clients, and office software.

## What are the various components of a Linux Desktop?

A Linux desktop typically consists of the following components:
- Desktop Environment: The graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the operating system. Examples include GNOME, KDE, and Xfce.
- Window Manager: The software that manages the placement and appearance of windows on the screen. Examples include Openbox, Fluxbox, and i3.
- Panel: The bar at the top or bottom of the screen that displays system information and provides access to shortcuts and applications. Examples include GNOME Panel and Xfce Panel.
- File Manager: The application that allows users to navigate and manage files and directories. Examples include Nautilus, Dolphin, and Thunar.


## What is a Linux distro?
A Linux distribution (or distro for short) is a **collection of software** that is packaged together to form a complete operating system.
Think of a Linux distro like a car. A car is made up of various components, such as the engine, the wheels, the seats, and the steering wheel. The Linux distro is the car, and the various components are the software that makes up the operating system. The thing is, most of these components are hard for beginners to understand, so I will try to explain them in the simplest way possible.

There are three main types of Linux distros:
- {{< logo src="debian.png" alt="Debian Logo" >}} **Debian-based distros**: These are known for its stability and reliability. Examples include Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Zorin OS, and elementary OS.
- {{< logo src="arch.png" alt="Arch Linux Logo" >}} **Arch-based distros**: These distros are based on the Arch Linux operating system, which is a collection of software that is maintained and updated by a community of developers known as the Arch Linux Project. Examples include Artix, Manjaro, EndeavourOS.
- {{< logo src="redhat.png" alt="Red Hat Logo" >}} **Red Hat-based distros**: These are known for being the good middle ground between stability and up-to-date software. Examples include Fedora, CentOS, Nobara, Ultramarine, RisiOS, and RHEL.

- Desktop Environment and Window Manager
- Package Manager
- Applications and Packaging Formats (Native, Flatpak, AppImage, Snap)

Don't be scared of:

- Terminal and CLI
- File System Hierarchy
- Lack of Familiar software
- Hardware Compatibility issues
