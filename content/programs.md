{{< quote author="Linus Torvalds" >}}Software is like sex: It's better when it's free.{{< /quote >}}

With that being said, I do still use the occasional proprietary software, but I try to avoid it as much as possible.

## Basics

### OS/Distro
I daily drive {{< logo src="fedora.png" alt="Fedora logo" >}} [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/). It's fast, stable, and I already have it installed, so why bother changing it?

However, when I **need** to use Microsoft tools like Access (for school), I **have** to use {{< logo src="windows10.png" alt="Windows 10 logo" >}} [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10).

### Window Manager
{{< logo src="i3wm.png" alt="i3wm logo" >}} [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/). It's fast, simple, came pre-installed with Fedora, and serves all my basic needs.

### Web Browser
{{< logo src="firefox.png" alt="Firefox logo" >}} [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with the [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) user.js (a mixture of improvements to Firefox's privacy, security and speed (and some other QoL things)).
As per extensions, I use a **ton** of them, but the most notable ones are:
- {{< logo src="ublockorigin.png" alt="uBlockOrigin logo" >}} [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) to block ads, trackers and other annoyances (like cookie notices)
- {{< logo src="darkreader.png" alt="DarkReader logo" >}} [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) to get dark mode everywhere
- {{< logo src="bitwarden.png" alt="Bitwarden logo" >}} [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/) as my [password manager](#password-manager)

### Text Editor
{{< logo src="neovim.png" alt="Neovim logo" >}} [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) or {{< logo src="vscode.png" alt="Visual Studio Code logo" >}} [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), depending on the project.

### Terminal
{{< logo src="alacritty.png" alt="Alacritty logo" >}} [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) with {{< logo src="bash.png" alt="Bash logo" >}} [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). At some point I might try {{< logo src="zsh.png" alt="Zsh logo" >}} [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), but as of now, I don't need it.
I also use {{< logo src="tmux.png" alt="Tmux logo" >}} [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) to keep terminal sessions and [powerline-shell](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell) to make my terminal look fancy.

## Utilities

### File Manager
{{< logo src="thunar.png" alt="Thunar logo" >}} [Thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) or [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) (if I want to look fancy). I don't really need anything too complex, I just have to be able to browse my files effectively.

### Video Player
{{< logo src="mpv.png" alt="mpv logo" >}} [mpv](https://mpv.io/). You guessed it! It's free, open-source, fast, and I mean, it's mpv.

---

## Productivity

### Image Manipulation
{{< logo src="gimp.png" alt="GIMP logo" >}} [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). Once again: It's free, open-source and has all the features I need.

### Video Editing
I haven't really been editing many videos but when I did, I used {{< logo src="vegaspro.png" alt="VEGAS Pro logo" >}} [VEGAS Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/en/vegas-pro/) (on Windows) and more recently {{< logo src="davinciresolve.png" alt="Davinci Resolve logo" >}} [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/), which works on Linux.

### Audio Editing
{{< logo src="tenacity.png" alt="Tenacity logo" >}} [Tenacity](https://tenacityaudio.org/) because Audacity started to ship with telemetry. It's free, open-source and has all the features I need.

### Office Suite
{{< logo src="libreoffice.png" alt="Libreoffice logo" >}} [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or {{< logo src="microsoftoffice.png" alt="Microsoft Office logo" >}} [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com/) (on Windows).

## Online Services

### Password Manager
{{< logo src="bitwarden.png" alt="Bitwarden logo" >}} [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). It's free, open-source and, as of now (02/2023), trustworthy enough for me. I **have** used KeePass and other apps that support KeePass formats, and they're fine, but I need to access my passwords outside my main devices.

### Email
{{< logo src="tutanota.png" alt="Tutanota logo">}} [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/). Not very feature rich, but it's really cheap, end-to-end encrypted, green and has its clients open-source.

### VPS
{{< logo src="hetzner.png" alt="Hetzner logo" >}} [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/). It's where I'm hosting this website, a Minecraft server, and others. They're cheap, reliable and have a great support team.

### Domains
{{< logo src="namecheap.png" alt="Namecheap logo" >}} [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I've been using them for a while now and I've never had any issues with them. They're cheap, reliable and have a great support team.

### DNS Management
{{< logo src="cloudflare.png" alt="Cloudflare logo" >}} [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). I've been using them for a while now and I've never had any issues with them. They're cheap, reliable and have a great support team.
